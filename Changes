Revision history for Arff-Util

0.01    Date/time
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

1.2	Following bugs fixed:

* It is necessary to state explicitly that error_count is 0 on startup, otherwise the package crashes with "use strict" enabled
* Arff files with nominal values that contain quoted commas are not read correctly -- a simple "split /,/" is not sufficient, but using Text::CSV solves the problem

1.22	

* added "allow_loose_escapes => 1" parameter to Text::CSV object
* META.yml fixed
